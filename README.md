By day I'm a sysadmin managing risk 24/7. What kind of risk? Financial risk, reputation risk and operational risk... Everything.

I architect, implement, administer and troubleshoot services, servers and infrastructure devices (local and cloud-based). I have a love for elegant solutions, especially if I can solve them with Powershell!

I write about things I am familiar with, things I'm learning, and the things that I've had to understand to help others understand.
